# CIFAR-10 CNN Classifier

A small PyTorch project where a Convolutional Neural Network is trained to recognize objects in the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The goal of this project is to understand how CNNs work on real RGB images and how model performance changes compared to simpler datasets like MNIST.

## What this project covers

- Working with color image data (3-channel inputs)
- Building and training a basic CNN architecture
- Using convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers
- Evaluating predictions and inspecting incorrect classifications

---

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib

---

## Purpose

This project focuses on learning CNN behavior on a more challenging dataset rather than optimizing for maximum accuracy.
