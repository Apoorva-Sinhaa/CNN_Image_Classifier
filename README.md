# CIFAR-10 CNN Image Classifier

A Python project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into predefined object categories.

The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and learns to recognize common objects such as vehicles and animals from color images.

---

## What this project does

- Trains a CNN to classify images into 10 object classes
- Processes RGB images using convolution and pooling layers
- Predicts the most likely object category for each image
- Visualizes model predictions to understand correct and incorrect classifications

---

## Why this project

This project was built to understand how CNNs extract visual features from images and how object classification works on real-world color image datasets.

It also explores the differences in model behavior between simpler datasets and more complex image data.

## Tools Used

- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib

## Notes

This project focuses on learning image classification using CNNs rather than optimizing for high accuracy or production use.
